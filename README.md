- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jedkutai
- I am very interested in game developement, but I am very new to coding so I am working overtime to learn everything I need to create an idea of mine.
If you see any holes in anything I do, feel free to point them out to me. People critiquing my work can only help me learn faster.
